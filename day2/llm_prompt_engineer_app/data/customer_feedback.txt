The new XYZ-Pro vacuum cleaner worked perfectly for the first two weeks,
but then the brush attachment stopped spinning. It makes a strange grinding
noise now. I'm very disappointed with the durability. Also, the battery life
is not as advertised; it only lasts about 20 minutes on full power.
The mobile app for scheduling cleans is intuitive though, that's a plus.
